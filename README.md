# Mini-Search-Engine

A simple search engine that allows users to add articles, search them by keywords or tags, and retrieve results sorted by relevance or date. This project demonstrates a basic text-based search engine functionality using Node.js and Express.

## Features
- **Add Articles**: Add articles with a title, content, and tags.
- **Search Articles**: Search articles by keywords or tags in the title or content.
- **Sort Results**: Sort search results by relevance or by date.
- **Optional Persistence**: Articles can be saved in a `data.json` file for persistence across server restarts.

## Tech Stack
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **Express**: Web framework for building the API.
- **JSON**: Used for storing article data (with optional persistence in `data.json`).
- **cURL/Postman**: For interacting with the API.
